The site uses a relaxing palette. That is visually pleasing and provides a good contrast for fonts and backgrounds.

### Typography

Google fonts was used to import the Lato and Aleo fonts. Both are sans-serif and provide a pleasing reading experience.

### Imagery 

All imagery was found from multiple wesbites, all named and credited in the Credits section.
